			<h2>Description of the process:</h2></br>
			<p>Pendulum(1) hits the ball which on rolling hits the hinged bar(2) and ball goes into bucket(5). Hinged Bar upon rotating hits the next ball which again hits the hinged bar and itself falls into basket(3). Similarly, total two balls fall in bucket(5) and bucket(3) each. Now, Bucket(3) lowers and hit bar(4) which upon rotating again hits the adjacent bar and consequently last bar hits the bucket(5) which on movig empties itself and thus the two balls fall on surface(6) and rolls to surface(13). When Bucket(3) lowers, bar (7) moves up and tilts bar(8) resulting in the rolling of ball which falls on the next bar and itself falls into surface (13). When ball hits the bar, hook at (9) breaks and thus ball 10 lowers and rolls onto the bar (11) hitting the hammer which after rotating hits the ball from back to move the ball into the tunnel (12). After that this ball reaches surface(13).</p></br>

			<p>The stopper at (13) breaks upon collecting 4 balls , thus making the way for balls to hit bar(14), which moves bar (15) upwards resulting in the motion of 3 balls towards dominos and consequently last domino falls on bar (17) to make open the way for the balls.
			Balls upon descending from bar (14), moves towards (17) and in the process two balls fall in the pit.</p></br>

			<p> Now one ball from (17) falls and hits ball (18) and finally hits pendulum (20). Ball (18) moves towards the open circuit and switches on the electromagnet which cathches the next ball falling from position (17). pendulum(20) moves and domino (21) falls on the bar below it and tilts it so that big ball moves towards position (24). Domino also hits ball (22) , which upon moving his the weight at (23) , thus causing the lever attached to pulley throw the big ball at (24) inside the tunnel. Big Ball hits the all other ball at (25) and each ball falls on the spring (26) which throws them over the piston (27). All balls start pushing the piston which blows air to move the boat at (28).</p></br>
