			<h2>Explanation</h2><br>
			<p>Pendulum hits the ball which on rolling hits the hinged bar and ball goes on the curved surface.
			Hinged Bar upon rotating hits the next ball which again hits the hinged bar and itself falls into basket attached to pulley.
			Similarly, one balls fall in bucket on left and two balls in bucket connected to pulley.
			Now, puley lowers on left side and hit bar which upon rotating again hits the adjacent bar and consequently last bar hits the bucket containing ball which on moving empties itself and thus the ball fall on the surface below and rolls towards hole.
			When pulley lowers, bar moves up and tilts another bar resulting in the rolling of ball which falls on the next bar and itself falls on arc and than inside the hole.When ball hits the bar, pulley rotates and  thus ball lowers and rolls onto the bar and hits the hammer which after rotating hits the ball from back to move the ball into the tunnel. After that this ball reaches surface and moves through the hole.</p></br>

			<p>The hole opens below and thus making the way for balls to hit bar, which moves stage of balls upwards resulting in the motion of 3 balls one by one towards dominos and consequently domino falls on rotating platform and tilts it forward to make way for the balls.
			Balls upon descending from bar, moves towards rotating platform and in the process three balls fall in the pit.</p></br>

			<p> Now one ball falls and hits pendulum.Pendulum moves and hits domino, resulting in domino falling on the bar below it and tilts it so that domino hits small ball, which upon moving hits the weight, and weight falls and pulls platform up and the ball on the platform flies towards the tunnel. Ball hits the Big Balls and moves them towards the motor which throws them towards fulcrum and tilts it. Fructum now hits the boat and moves it.</p><br>
